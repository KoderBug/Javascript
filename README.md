# Javascript
The Javascript drills are simple, short functions to learn how Javascript works with HTML to make web pages more dynamic and how to embed scripts within an HTML file.

For the Pizza Menu Project the requirements were to create an online pizza menu system using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  There were requirements for the toppings and pricing needed to create a receipt for the customer's order.  In this Pizza Menu Project an external file is included in the HTML to give added functionality to the web page.  In this application the Calc() function is called in the javascript file when the Order button is clicked.  The Clearscreen() function is called when the Cancel button is clicked and the screen is reset.
